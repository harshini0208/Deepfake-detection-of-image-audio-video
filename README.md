# Deepfake-detection-of-image-audio-video
This project builds a multi-modal deepfake detection system using CNNs for images, MFCC with deep learning for audio, and InceptionV3-GRU for video analysis. It identifies facial inconsistencies, synthetic speech, and lip-sync issues, enhancing detection accuracy across media formats to combat misinformation and ensure digital content authenticity.
